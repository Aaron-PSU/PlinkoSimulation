This program simulates the game plinko. running the simulation "N" number
of times (defined by the user), it outputs the probability of the disc 
landing in each collum.

Default plinko board is plinko1.txt. If a selection is made other than 1,
2, or 3, this board will be used. Boards are simple text files containing
the dementions of the board as well as X's and O's to represent 'pins' and
'free-spaces' respectivly.
